### What problem we solving?
We need to write a programm that guess the number with the least possible tries

**Competition Conditions:**
- The computer generates a random integer between 0 and 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess," we mean "write a program that guesses the number."
- The algorithm takes into account whether the random number is greater or smaller than the one we are looking for.
- The algorithm has to guess the number under 20 tries

**Quality Metric**
Results are evaluated based on the average number of attempts in 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
Learn to write a good Python code
